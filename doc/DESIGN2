The basic concept is the struct.

A struct is made up of:
    - Primitives
      - int, double, etc.
      - "references"
      - "external references"
    - Other Structs

Structs are immutable values. This means a couple things:
 - The user can't tell if we pass-by-copy, pass by reference,
   or pass by refcounted reference.
 - Refcounted data structures are cycle free.
 - We can select between copy / rc-ref at compile time based
   on the size of the object.

We can use struct directly as "stack frames". This makes a
"spaghetti stack" or singly linked list of frames.


Random ideas:
 - Can use tests to pre-specialize code.
